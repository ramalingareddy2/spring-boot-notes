What are starter dependencies why do we need to use them?
We can build different technology applications while working with Spring Framework, so while creating the project based on the technology we want to use we need add the relevant spring Framework module dependency and other modules of Spring Framework our module is dependent on with appropriate version. In addition we need to even add external libraries that are needed for these modules with compatible versions.
Compiling the list of dependencies needed for developing Spring Framework project of a specific technology is going to be very complex and requires more time as well. Instead of that Spring Boot has provided starter dependencies.

Spring Boot Starter dependencies are maven empty projects declared with transitive dependencies as spring modules and external libraries. Spring boot has come up with several starter dependencies pertaining to different technologies that we use in building Spring Framework application.

Dependents on the technology in which we want to build Application, identify the appropriate starter dependency and add to our project. So it takes care of pulling all the necessary dependencies that are required for that technology.

all the spring boot starter dependencies are maven artifacts published in maven repository and are identified using the gav coordinates.
groupId=org.springframework.boot
artifactId=spring-boot-starter-*
version=2.4.3 (current)

1. Create an maven project
  -> start adding spring-boot-starter dependencies based on the technology and ensure all the starters we use are of same spring boot version.
