@SpringBootApplication
It is equal to 3 annotations
1. @Configuration
2. @ComponentScan
3. @EnableAutoConfiguration
Instead of writing 3 annotations on top of our class Spring Boot has provided one single annotation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
What will happens when we execute the below line of code?
SpringApplication.run(JavaConfig.class, args);

The entire spring boot system has been build into a class called SpringApplication class. When we call a static method run() on this by passing JavaConfig.class, it takes care of performing several startup activities in running a spring boot application.
  
1. creates an empty Environment object  
2. Detects the external configurations of our application and gathers them and loads into Environment object
3. print spring boot banner
4. it detects/identifies the type of the application using the property WebApplicationType
    4.1 it checks to see under the classpath of our application for spring webmvc jar, if found it treats the WebApplicationType = WEB and creates the ioc container of AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext
    4.2 if not then it checks for web flux jars under the classpath if found then treats the WebApplicationType as REACTIVE and creates the ioc container of type AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext
    4.3 if none of the above, then it creates an ioc container of type AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
5. It instantiates the SpringFactories and register them with ioc container
6. It executes the ApplicationContextInitializer 
7. prepareContext
8. refreshContext
9. executes the commandLineRunners and applicationRunners and returns the reference of ioc container to us
10. during the above operations being perform at various different stages, it is going to publish the events and executes the listeners
